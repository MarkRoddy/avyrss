There is an app for receiving forecasts over email, but there is no method to subscribe to these forecasts via RSS. The goal of this app is to make the forecasts accessible in a feed reader of your choice.

## Target Users
Backcountry users interested in regular updates on snowpack conditions. This would not be your method of consuming forecasts if you are actively planning a trip, but it is a useful way of consuming forecasts if you are looking to obtain general awareness of snowpack conditions in a particular zone.
